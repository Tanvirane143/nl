e. Tokenization using Keras.
Keras, a popular deep learning library, includes utilities for text preprocessing, including tokenization. The keras.preprocessing.text module provides the Tokenizer class, which can convert text into sequences of tokens suitable for training machine learning models.

Code : 
from keras.preprocessing.text import text_to_word_sequence
# define
text = """Founded in 2002, SpaceX’s mission is to enable humans to become a spacefa
ring civilization and a multi-planet
species by building a selfsustaining city on Mars. In 2008, SpaceX’s Falcon 1 became the first privately deve
loped
liquid-fuel launch vehicle to orbit the Earth."""
# tokenize
result = text_to_word_sequence(text)
print(result)
